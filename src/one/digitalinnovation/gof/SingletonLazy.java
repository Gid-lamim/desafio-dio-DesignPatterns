 * Singleton Java :
 *      Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only
 *      one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access
 *      to it for any other code. Singleton has almost the same pros and cons
 *      as global variables. Although they're super-handy, they break the
 *      modularity of your code.
